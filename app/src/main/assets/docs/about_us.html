        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>I'm Mylan Chan and am studying Information Technology at HKU SPACE.Â Cedule is one of the few programs I have made for now. I've tried to create a Markdown editor and a sleep-tracking app before. Every time I have some result of the development or fix a bug, I always feel satisfied about them. Also, I can create a tailor-made app for my daily life. That's why I am passionate about programming. Finally, I hope Cedule can also help you manage your tasks and schedules.</p>
